This is a short guide for setting up and running the second SD assignment, the Client-Server 'WasteLess' application. 

What I uploaded:
	-sd_assignment2 archive: the eclipse project of this application, containing both the server 
and the client side of the app.
	-wastelessdb_script: SQL for importing the tables and data of the 
app's database (MySQL).

How to run it:
	1) Create a new schema in MySQL(preferably named 'wasteless_db', but if another name is used, modify the url in the 'hibernate.cfg.xml'
file from the project's folder with the new schema's name). Then, import the data from 'wastelessdb_script'.
	
	2) Import the project in Eclipse(File->Import->General->Existing Project into Workspace) and setup a server(I used Tomcat). 
If there's an unresolved import please update the project(right-click project folder -> maven -> update project).
	
	3) Modify the 'WLClient.java' file from the client package to send requests to the server with correct addresses\
(in the source file, where the HttpURLConnection objects are initialized, modify the URL so that it works with your server's 
configuration. By default the URL is 'http://localhost:8081/sd-assignment2/...'). 

	4) Modify the paths of the report files given as properties in the 'wasteLessClient' bean defined inside the applicationContext.xml file.

	5) Change the root and password of the database's connection in the 'hibernate.cfg.xml' file. Also change the connection url if the schema
is not named 'wasteless_db'.

	6) Run the project on server then run the 'Main.java' file as a java application.
